An interactive web application built with Streamlit that calculates and visualizes the gravitational force between two touching unit cubes. This project provides an educational walkthrough of solving a classic numerical analysis problem (Trefethen's Problem #5) using the elegant Prideaux method combined with Gaussian Quadrature.

## ## Overview

Calculating the gravitational attraction between two cubes that are in direct contact is a surprisingly difficult problem. A direct integration approach fails due to a singularity where the cubes touch (the distance between points becomes zero).

This application demonstrates the solution proposed by J. Prideaux (2002), which cleverly circumvents the singularity by:

1.  **Decomposing** each cube into 8 smaller sub-cubes.
2.  **Classifying** the 64 resulting sub-cube pairs into types: Face, Edge, Vertex, and Separated.
3.  **Using recursion and scaling laws** to solve for the forces between touching pairs based on the forces of the easily calculable "Separated" pairs.
4.  **Employing Gaussian Quadrature**, accelerated with Numba, for the high-dimensional numerical integration required for the separated pairs.

## ## Key Features

- **Interactive Simulation:** Adjust the order of the Gaussian Quadrature in real-time to see its effect on accuracy and computation time.
- **Step-by-Step Explanation:** The app is structured with tabs that guide the user from the initial problem statement to the final result.
- **Rich Visualizations:** 3D plots of the cube configurations, diagrams of the Prideaux decomposition, and charts illustrating the numerical methods.
- **High-Precision Result:** Accurately calculates the final force to approximately 10 decimal places, matching the known literature value.
